		<h1> Why Sigma Kappa?</h1>
		<p>In order to demonstrate member's love for our chapter, we collected their responses
			on why they love Sigma Kappa Alpha Mu. From favorite memories, to friendships that
			last a lifetime, you can see how strong of a connection alumni and current members 
			feel towards our sorority. </p>

		<p>"We love SK because of how welcoming, approachable, and 
			supportive everyone in the house is. It has been so fun getting to 
			know everyone better this semester and we feel that our confidence has 
			skyrocketed as we’ve been able to further our connections with each other. 
			Whether you want someone to get ready with on game days, or you need someone to 
			walk with you to the library, there are always girls who won’t hesitate to join you. 
			These women have been nothing but uplifting and it is already evident 
			that we are all family!" </p>

		<h2> Anna Osborne </h2>
		<img src = "images/two.jpeg" alt = "Anna Osborne"/>
		<p>"I was very lucky to grow up with a sister so close in age to me and really missed having 
			her as my right hand after I left for college. I love living with a group of girls who 
			are all so supportive and have such diverse hobbies and areas of study. It’s so amazing 
			hearing about all of the incredible things girls in our chapter are doing and encouraging 
			each other along the way"</p>

		<p> "I was always hesitant to rush but am now SO happy I did. Through SK, I met remarkably 
			intelligent, talented, diverse, kind, and loyal friends. Our different experiences, 
			backgrounds, and personalities foster and enhance meaningful relationships among us. 
			I’m forever grateful for SK and all the amazing people and experiences it’s brought 
			into my life! Lots of love!!"</p>

		<h2>Emily Daum</h2>
		<img src = "images/four.jpeg" alt = "Emily Daum"/>
		<p> "Like many others, I was super nervous about recruitment and had no idea what to expect 
			from it. But, as soon as I walked into SK I immediately felt comfortable because of the 
			genuine, interesting, and funny conversations I had throughout the process. I soon fell in 
			love with my PC and have found every single girl to most kind-hearted, intelligent, and 
			motivating people I’ve ever met. Forever grateful to have made the decision to join SK"</p>

		<h2>Elizabeth Yang</h2>
		<img src = "images/five.jpeg" alt = "Elizabeth Yang"/>
		<p> "Joining SK was probably one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. SK introduced me to so 
			many unique, amazing, and inspiring girls that I can now confidently say are all my best 
			friends. I am so lucky to have all my sisters by my side through thick and thin, and I 
			genuinely couldn’t imagine my college experience without them"</p>
