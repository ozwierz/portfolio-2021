            <h2> The Alzheimer's Association</h2>
            <p>The Alzheimer's disease is the sixth-leading cause of death in 
                the United States, but there is not cure. Therefore, Sigma Kappa is 
                committed to ending Alzheimer's by generating immense donations and 
                participating in fundraisers. The main fundraiser, that all Sigma Kappa 
                members at the University of Michigan are required to participate in, is 
                the Walk to End Alzheimer's. This is the largest event to raise runds 
                and awareness for Alzheimer's research and support. In 2021, Ann Arbor
                members raised over $6,000! </p> <br>

            <h2>Inherit the Earth</h2>
            <p>Improving the environment is a big part of Sigma Kappa. The members strive
                to make a lasting impact on the planet. Inherit the Earth is a service project 
                that provides college students and other community memebers to improve local 
                environments. Each year, Sigma Kappa Alpha Mu conducts a trash collection at 
                the local fraternities on campus for Earth Day. In 2021, 704 pounds of trash 
                was collected!</p>

            <h2>Gerontolgy</h2>
            <p> To corresponds with the emphasis on Alzheimer's, Sigma Kappa also recognizes 
                the needs of the elderly population. Members volunteer to support and communicate 
                with elderly in their local Ann Arbor community as a part of this interest in gerontology.
                In 2021, members created Valentine's Day cards for a nearby senior living facility
                since many were unable to see their family members due to COVID-19.</p>
